# UC Berkeley Graduate School Preparation Course - Session 6 Summary

## Overview
This is Session 6 of the US Graduate School Preparation Course (BUS ADM X495.8) created by Sally Clapper at UC Berkeley's BGA Program. The session focuses on two main topics:
1. **Securing Strong Letters of Recommendation**
2. **Preparing for Standardized Graduate School Exams**

---

## Part 1: Letters of Recommendation (LORs)

### The Request Process

**Best Practices:**
- Engage in a **face-to-face meeting** if possible before asking for a formal letter
- If meeting isn't feasible, use email or phone call as alternatives

**Three-Step Process:**
1. Schedule a meeting or send an initial request via email
2. Discuss your goals and why you value their recommendation
3. After receiving confirmation, provide a detailed written request

### Example Request Email

The presentation provides a template:

```
Dear Professor [Surname],

Thank you for considering my request to write a Letter of Recommendation for me for programs I am applying to for Fall 2025.

I am aiming for [program name] at [school name] to further my aspirations in [your discipline]. The application deadline is [date].

For your convenience, I've attached my CV, Statement of Purpose (SOP), and relevant details about the program ([link]). Your insights on my performance in [specific course/subject] would be particularly valuable. Please let me know if you need further information.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
```

### Timing is Crucial

- **Approach recommenders well in advance**: preferably a month or more before the deadline
- This gives them ample time to write a thoughtful and detailed letter
- **Tip**: Send a polite reminder as the deadline approaches

### Provide Detailed Information

**Include:**
1. Your CV and academic transcripts
2. Details of past accomplishments, projects, or research
3. A personal statement or Statement of Purpose (SOP)
4. Clear information about your motivations, aspirations, and specific program details

**Important tip**: The more information you provide, the easier it will be for the professor to write a personalized letter.

### Asking in Advance

Even if you're not applying immediately, it's good to ask for recommendations from professors whose classes you're currently taking:

**Tips:**
- Make the request while your work is still fresh in their memory
- Be clear about your timeline and commitment to keeping them updated

**Example advance request email provided** (slide 9) emphasizes:
- Expressing gratitude for the research/learning experience
- Requesting the LOR for future applications
- Acknowledging you won't be applying for another year
- Committing to providing updates every few months

### Two Request Approaches

**Option A - Asking without sharing documents initially:**
- Ask if they're willing to write the letter
- Offer to provide documentation if they agree
- Mention you have guides and sample letters available if helpful

**Option B - Attaching documents to initial request:**
- Include CV, writing sample, statement of purpose, personality assessments
- Explain reasons for grad school and career goals
- Ask how you can make the process easier

## Study Techniques and Preparation Strategies

### Always Start with a Baseline
- Take a full-length diagnostic practice test first
- Begin a Missed Questions Log (MQL)

### Split Your Schedule Into 2 Phases

#### **Phase 1: Content Mastery** (Approximately first 3 weeks for 2-month plan)
- Focus: **70% on material you need to know** for the test, **30% on practice problems**
- For GRE specifically:
  - **Quantitative Reasoning**: 4 main fields of math, each covers 10-15 concepts
  - **Verbal Reasoning**: Reading Comprehension, Text Completion, and Sentence Equivalence
- Alternate between Math and Verbal Reasoning sections
- Take full-length practice tests periodically

**Sample Daily Structure** (from slide 29):
- Day 1: QR-Arithmetic (Integers, divisibility, etc.) + VR Vocabulary (20 new words)
- Day 2: QR-Algebra + VR Vocabulary + Practice
- Days continue alternating between content areas
- Day 7: Flex Day for QR + Review vocabulary

#### **Phase 2: Practice Phase** (Remaining weeks)
- Focus: **70% on practice questions**, **30% on vocab and math review**
- Increase practice sets and timed sections
- Continue Missed Questions Log
- Weekly full-length practice tests
- Review weak areas systematically

**Sample Practice Phase Structure** (slide 30):
- Practice sets for specific topics
- Mixed practice sets
- Writing essays (for tests that require them)
- Vocabulary review
- Regular MQL review
- Full-length practice exams every 7 days

### Detailed 3-Month Study Schedule

The presentation provides an extremely detailed 84-day (12-week) study plan with:
- Daily tasks specified for each section
- Content mastery in Weeks 1-4
- Practice phase in Weeks 5-12
- Checkboxes for tracking completion
- Strategic flex days
- Rest day before test day

**Key elements of the schedule:**
- Vocabulary: Learning 20 new words most days, building to 1,000+ words
- Quantitative Reasoning: Systematic coverage of all math topics
- Verbal Reasoning: All question types practiced
- Analytical Writing: Regular essay practice and outline creation
- Full practice tests: Every 7 days in later weeks

### Additional Study Tips

**From the presentation:**
- Use the **Pomodoro method** (focused study intervals with breaks)
- Find a **study group or accountability partner**
- **Drill mini problem sets** (5, 8, or 10 questions all within the same topic/field)
- **Alternate which sections** you study each week
- **Weekly practice tests** near the end of preparation

### Importance of an Error Log

**Also known as Missed Question Log (MQL)**

Template includes columns for:
- **Problem** number/identification
- **Content Tested**
- **What I Did Wrong**
- **TAKEAWAY** (lesson learned)
- **Re-do Date**

**Example entries shown:**
- Overlapping Sets problem: "I will always double check which subgroup I am supposed to be focused on"
- Sentence Completion: "I will be on the lookout for words like 'Either' and 'Neither', and will double check subject-verb agreement"
